 * The HydraPacketListener interface is a wrapper for every kind of listener that is supposed to handle packet events.
 * Simply implement it, but use the {@link PacketHandler} for methods
 * that are supposed to handle a packet. See the examples for more accurate information on the correct usage of the
 * PacketHandler annotation.
